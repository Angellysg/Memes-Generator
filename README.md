# **Memes Generator**
Memes Generator is a project in which I use Html, CSS and JavaScript.

The objective of this project is that you can customize an image through a url to turn it into a Meme, which you can create or edit.
This project has features like:

* Change the background color. <br>
* Modify brightness, opacity, saturation and others.

In addition to :

* Add top and bottom text or not.<br>
* Select the font type.<br>
* Change font size, and others.

You can switch from light mode to dark mode and vice versa.

I invite you to use it and Create or Edit your Memes.
